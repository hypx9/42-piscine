# 🏊 42 Piscine – First immersion

**My code from the legendary 42 bootcamp.**  
A month of raw coding, sleepless nights, and endless compilation errors.  
Here lies the beginning — shell scripts, pure C, and the will to understand the machine.

## ⚙️ Compilation

All C exercises follow the 42 standards:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror file.c -o output
```

No standard library unless allowed. No shortcuts. Just raw understanding.

## 🧠 What I learned

- Navigating the Unix shell like a second language  
- Writing clean, norm-compliant C code  
- Understanding memory, pointers, and data manipulation  
- Building logic under pressure and strict constraints  
- Embracing failure as part of the process

## 🗓️ When?

This was completed during my Piscine 42 in **[september/2024]**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All code was written by me, during the piscine.  
**If you're currently doing yours: don’t copy — swim.**  
Learn, struggle, overcome. That’s how you grow.
